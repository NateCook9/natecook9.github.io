    <p>Hi! I'm Nate Cook, a PhD student researching language, bilingualism, and emotion at the University of Illinois Chicago. This site is a hub for my academic work, ongoing projects, and research materials.</p>
    <p>My current research interests range broadly from bilingualism, emotional processing, language acquisition, social cognition, and Natural Language Processing.</p>
    <p>I also am an enthusiastic teacher. I love teaching Spanish as an additional language and enjoy using the task-based language teaching approach when instructing Spanish.</p>
