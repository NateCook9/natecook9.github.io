# About Me

Hi! I’m Nate Cook, a PhD student researching language, bilingualism, and emotion at the University of Illinois Chicago. My current research interests range broadly from bilingualism, emotional processing, language acquisition, social cognition, and Natural Language Processing. Outside of school, Nate enjoys getting outside to play sports, take in the Lake Michigan breeze, and explore Chicago’s many cool neighborhoods.
